Metal Extractor | cormex.png | The metal extractor is the primary means of getting metal. \n If you have excess energy, metal extractors will automatically use it to extract more metal.
Solar Collector | armsolar.png | Solar collectors are the least cost-efficient of the energy structures, but they are also the most reliable and sturdy. When attacked, solars will curl up into armored form, which offers excellent protection against raiders.
Puppy | puppy.png | This fast-moving suicide unit is very good against massed units, particularly assault tanks. Chain explodes terribly, so best not to mass it. Counter with defenders and missile trucks, or single cheap units to set off a premature detonation. \n When standing next to nearby metal debris, the puppy can replicate itself using the scrap metal to produce even more puppies!
